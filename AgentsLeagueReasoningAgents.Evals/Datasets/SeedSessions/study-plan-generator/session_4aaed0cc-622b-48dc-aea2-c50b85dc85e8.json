We have included two versions of the Skills Measured objectives depending on when you are taking the exam.\\nWe always update the English language version of the exam first. Some exams are localized into other languages, and those are updated approximately eight weeks after the English version is updated. While Microsoft makes every effort to update localized exams as noted, there may be times when the localized versions of an exam are not updated on this schedule. Other available languages are listed in the **Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the exam isn\\u0027t available in your preferred language, you can request an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam.\\n#### Note\\nThe bullets that follow each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill.

An enrichment pipeline has the same core components as a typical indexer (indexer, data source, index), plus a skill set that specifies the atomic enrichment steps. A skill set can be assembled by using built-in skills based on the Foundry Tools APIs, such as [Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis) and [Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview), or [custom skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-create-custom-skill-example) that run external code that you provide.\\n**Vector search**\\nVector search is a method of information retrieval where documents and queries are represented in an index as vectors instead of plain text. In vector search, machine learning models, hosted externally from Azure AI Search, generate the vector representations of source inputs, which can be text, images, audio, or video content. This mathematical and normalized representation of content, called vector embeddings, provides a common basis for search scenarios.\\nWhen everything is a vector, a query can find a match in vector space, even if the associated original content is in a different media type, such as images versus text, or language than the query. The search engine scans the index looking for vector content that is most similar, that is, the closest, to the vector in the query. Matching on a mathematical vector representation instead of keywords makes it far more likely to find matches that share semantic meaning but are textually distinct, such as \\u0022car\\u0022 and \\u0022auto,\\u0022 for example. This gives a more detailed introduction to vector embeddings and how the similarity algorithm works.\\n### Key terms\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/search/transparency-note?view=foundry-classic#the-basics-of-azure-ai-search\u0022}]}"}],"structuredContent":{"results":[{"title":"Course AI-102T00-A: Develop AI solutions in Azure - Training","content":"Course \r\n\r\n# Develop AI solutions in Azure\r\n\r\n Course AI-102T00-A: Develop AI solutions in Azure \r\n\r\n## At a glance\r\n\r\n- Level \r\n\r\n[Intermediate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?levels=intermediate\u0026amp;resource_type=course)\r\n- Product \r\n\r\n[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?products=azure\u0026amp;resource_type=course)\r\n- Role \r\n\r\n[AI Engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?roles=ai-engineer\u0026amp;resource_type=course)\r\n- Subject \r\n\r\n[Artificial intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?subjects=artificial-intelligence\u0026amp;resource_type=course)\r\n- Languages \r\n\r\nEnglishArabicChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)FrenchGermanIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanPortuguese (Brazil)Spanish\r\n- Course Duration \r\n\r\n5 days\r\n- Related certifications \r\n\r\n[Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/)\r\n\r\n**Achievement Code**\r\n\r\nWould you like to request an achievement code?\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAI-102: Develop AI solutions in Azure is intended for software developers wanting to build AI infused applications that leverage Azure AI Foundry and other Azure AI services.

An enrichment pipeline has the same core components as a typical indexer (indexer, data source, index), plus a skill set that specifies the atomic enrichment steps. A skill set can be assembled by using built-in skills based on the Foundry Tools APIs, such as [Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis) and [Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview), or [custom skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-create-custom-skill-example) that run external code that you provide.\n**Vector search**\nVector search is a method of information retrieval where documents and queries are represented in an index as vectors instead of plain text. In vector search, machine learning models, hosted externally from Azure AI Search, generate the vector representations of source inputs, which can be text, images, audio, or video content. This mathematical and normalized representation of content, called vector embeddings, provides a common basis for search scenarios.\nWhen everything is a vector, a query can find a match in vector space, even if the associated original content is in a different media type, such as images versus text, or language than the query. The search engine scans the index looking for vector content that is most similar, that is, the closest, to the vector in the query. Matching on a mathematical vector representation instead of keywords makes it far more likely to find matches that share semantic meaning but are textually distinct, such as \u0022car\u0022 and \u0022auto,\u0022 for example. This gives a more detailed introduction to vector embeddings and how the similarity algorithm works.\n### Key terms","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/search/transparency-note?view=foundry-classic#the-basics-of-azure-ai-search"}]}}},{"$type":"functionResult","callId":"call_f73cjyGIJs8i6r6BZ8Y4uWF5","result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{\u0022results\u0022:[{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Practice Assessments for Microsoft Certifications\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# Practice Assessments for Microsoft Certifications\\n## Availability\\nBelow is a list of all the Practice Assessments available.\\n| S/N | Practice Assessment| \\n|  --- | ---  |\\n| 1 | [AI-102: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice\\u0026assessmentId=61\\u0026practice-assessment-type=certification) |\\n| 2 | [AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice\\u0026assessmentId=26\\u0026practice-assessment-type=certification) |\\n| 3 | [AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice\\u0026assessmentId=21\\u0026practice-assessment-type=certification) |\\n| 4 | [AZ-140: Configuring and Operating Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-virtual-desktop-specialty/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice\\u0026assessmentId=69\\u0026practice-assessment-type=certification) |\\n| 5 | [AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice\\u0026assessmentId=35\\u0026practice-assessment-type=certification) |\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/practice-assessments-for-microsoft-certifications#availability\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Study guide for Exam AI-102: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# Study guide for Exam AI-102: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution\\n## Purpose of this document\\nThis study guide should help you understand what to expect on the exam and includes a summary of the topics the exam might cover and links to additional resources.

We have included two versions of the Skills Measured objectives depending on when you are taking the exam.\nWe always update the English language version of the exam first. Some exams are localized into other languages, and those are updated approximately eight weeks after the English version is updated. While Microsoft makes every effort to update localized exams as noted, there may be times when the localized versions of an exam are not updated on this schedule. Other available languages are listed in the **Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the exam isn\u0027t available in your preferred language, you can request an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam.\n#### Note\nThe bullets that follow each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill. Related topics may be covered in the exam.\n#### Note\nMost questions cover features that are general availability (GA).
