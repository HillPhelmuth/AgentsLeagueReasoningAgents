We have included two versions of the Skills Measured objectives depending on when you are taking the exam.\r\n\r\nWe always update the English language version of the exam first. Some exams are localized into other languages, and those are updated approximately eight weeks after the English version is updated. While Microsoft makes every effort to update localized exams as noted, there may be times when the localized versions of an exam are not updated on this schedule. Other available languages are listed in the **Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the exam isn\u0027t available in your preferred language, you can request an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nThe bullets that follow each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill. Related topics may be covered in the exam.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nMost questions cover features that are general availability (GA). The exam may contain questions on Preview features if those features are commonly used.\r\n\r\n## Skills measured as of December 23, 2025\r\n\r\n### Audience profile\r\n\r\nAs a Microsoft Azure AI engineer, you build, manage, and deploy AI solutions that leverage Azure AI.\r\n\r\nYour responsibilities include participating in all phases of AI solutions development, including:\r\n\r\n- Requirements definition and design\r\n- Development\r\n- Deployment\r\n- Integration\r\n- Maintenance\r\n- Performance tuning\r\n- Monitoring\r\n\r\nYou work with solution architects to translate their vision.
