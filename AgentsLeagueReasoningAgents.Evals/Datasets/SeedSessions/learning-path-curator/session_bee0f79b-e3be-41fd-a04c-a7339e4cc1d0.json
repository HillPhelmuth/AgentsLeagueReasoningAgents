This model coordinates user interaction, model inference, and tool execution in a deterministic loop.\\n![AI Agent Diagram](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/media/agent.svg)\\nImportant\\nIf you use Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization\\u0027s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.\\n## Simple agents based on inference services\\nAgent Framework makes it easy to create simple agents based on many different inference services. Any inference service that provides a [\\u0060Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient\\u0060](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai#the-ichatclient-interface) implementation can be used to build these agents. The \\u0060Microsoft.Agents.AI.ChatClientAgent\\u0060 is the agent class used to provide an agent for any [IChatClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.ai.ichatclient) implementation.\\nThese agents support a wide range of functionality out of the box:\\n1. Function calling.\\n2. Multi-turn conversations with local chat history management or service provided chat history management.\\n3. Custom service provided tools (for example, MCP, Code Execution).\\n4. Structured output.\\nTo create one of these agents, simply construct a \\u0060ChatClientAgent\\u0060 using the \\u0060IChatClient\\u0060 implementation of your choice.\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060csharp\\nusing Microsoft.Agents.AI;\\n\\nvar agent = new ChatClientAgent(chatClient, instructions: \\u0022You are a helpful assistant\\u0022);\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\nTo make creating these agents even easier, Agent Framework provides helpers for many popular services.

This allows for building common, agent agnostic, higher level functionality such as multi-agent orchestrations.\n## Default Agent Runtime Execution Model\nAll agents in the Microsoft Agent Framework execute using a structured runtime model. This model coordinates user interaction, model inference, and tool execution in a deterministic loop.\n![AI Agent Diagram](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/media/agent.svg)\nImportant\nIf you use Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization\u0027s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.\n## Simple agents based on inference services\nAgent Framework makes it easy to create simple agents based on many different inference services. Any inference service that provides a [\u0060Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient\u0060](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai#the-ichatclient-interface) implementation can be used to build these agents. The \u0060Microsoft.Agents.AI.ChatClientAgent\u0060 is the agent class used to provide an agent for any [IChatClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.ai.ichatclient) implementation.\nThese agents support a wide range of functionality out of the box:\n1. Function calling.\n2. Multi-turn conversations with local chat history management or service provided chat history management.\n3. Custom service provided tools (for example, MCP, Code Execution).\n4. Structured output.\nTo create one of these agents, simply construct a \u0060ChatClientAgent\u0060 using the \u0060IChatClient\u0060 implementation of your choice.\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\nusing Microsoft.Agents.AI;\n\nvar agent = new ChatClientAgent(chatClient, instructions: \u0022You are a helpful assistant\u0022);\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nTo make creating these agents even easier, Agent Framework provides helpers for many popular services.
