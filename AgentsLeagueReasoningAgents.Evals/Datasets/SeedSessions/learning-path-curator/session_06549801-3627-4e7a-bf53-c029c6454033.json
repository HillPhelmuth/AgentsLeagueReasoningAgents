There\\u0027s much to learn, but you can apply the skills you already have, including how to:\\n1. Make calls to APIs by using REST, JSON, or language-specific software development kits (SDKs)\\n2. Orchestrate calls to APIs and perform business logic\\n3. Store to and retrieve from data stores\\n4. Integrate input and results into the user experience\\n5. Create APIs that can be called from LLMs\\nDeveloping generative AI solutions build on your existing skills.\\n## Developer tools and services\\nMicrosoft builds tools, services, APIs, samples, and learning resources to help you start with generative AI. Each one covers a key part of building a generative AI solution. To use these resources well, make sure you:\\n1. Know the main functions, roles, and responsibilities for each type of generative AI feature. For example, in RAG-based chat systems, you need to understand the problem and its limits before you design a solution.\\n2. Learn about the APIs, services, and tools for each function or role. Once you know the problem, you can build it yourself with code, use low-code/no-code tools, or call existing services.\\n3. Explore your options, including code, low-code, and no-code solutions. You can build everything yourself, but sometimes it\\u0027s faster and easier to combine different tools and approaches.\\nThere\\u2019s no single right way to add generative AI features to your apps. You can choose from many tools and methods. Always weigh the pros and cons of each.\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/introduction-build-generative-ai-solutions#how-to-build-generative-ai-applications\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Chat with a local AI model using .NET\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# Chat with a local AI model using .NET\\nIn this quickstart, you learn how to create a conversational .NET console chat app using an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI model. The app uses the [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.ai) library so you can write code using AI abstractions rather than a specific SDK. AI abstractions enable you to change the underlying AI model with minimal code changes.\\n## Prerequisites\\n1. [Install .NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher\\n2. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/) locally on your device\\n3.

There\u0027s much to learn, but you can apply the skills you already have, including how to:\n1. Make calls to APIs by using REST, JSON, or language-specific software development kits (SDKs)\n2. Orchestrate calls to APIs and perform business logic\n3. Store to and retrieve from data stores\n4. Integrate input and results into the user experience\n5. Create APIs that can be called from LLMs\nDeveloping generative AI solutions build on your existing skills.\n## Developer tools and services\nMicrosoft builds tools, services, APIs, samples, and learning resources to help you start with generative AI. Each one covers a key part of building a generative AI solution. To use these resources well, make sure you:\n1. Know the main functions, roles, and responsibilities for each type of generative AI feature. For example, in RAG-based chat systems, you need to understand the problem and its limits before you design a solution.\n2. Learn about the APIs, services, and tools for each function or role. Once you know the problem, you can build it yourself with code, use low-code/no-code tools, or call existing services.\n3. Explore your options, including code, low-code, and no-code solutions. You can build everything yourself, but sometimes it\u0027s faster and easier to combine different tools and approaches.\nThere\u2019s no single right way to add generative AI features to your apps.
