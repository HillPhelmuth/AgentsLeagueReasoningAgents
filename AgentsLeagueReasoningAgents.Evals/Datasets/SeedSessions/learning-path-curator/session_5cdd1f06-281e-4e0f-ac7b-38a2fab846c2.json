Building and maintaining professional relationships can open doors to new opportunities, enhance your knowledge, and accelerate your growth. Networking is not just about collecting business cards or making connections on social media\\u2014it\\u2019s also about cultivating meaningful relationships that can positively impact your career path.\\nThe practice of networking is an invaluable source of knowledge and experience. When you connect with professionals who have more expertise in the industry (in this case, Azure services), you gain access to valuable insights, best practices, and industry trends. Engaging in conversations with like-minded individuals can expand your perspective, challenge your assumptions, and inspire innovative thinking.\\nNetworking events, conferences, and seminars provide opportunities to learn from industry leaders, attend workshops, and gain new knowledge that can enhance your skill set and help make you a more competitive professional in your new Azure role. Let\\u2019s explore some of these roles in greater detail.\\n## What do Azure solutions architects do?\\nAzure solutions architects play a crucial role in designing, implementing, and managing cloud-based solutions using Azure. They have a deep understanding of Azure services and can architect scalable and secure cloud infrastructures. As an Azure solution architect, you collaborate with clients or colleagues to develop cloud strategies, ensure optimal performance, and provide guidance on best practices. This role requires strong technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and the ability to align business objectives with cloud solutions.\\nThe Microsoft Certification exam for this role is Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions, which you can prepare for by completing self-paced AZ-305 learning paths on Microsoft Learn.

Building and maintaining professional relationships can open doors to new opportunities, enhance your knowledge, and accelerate your growth. Networking is not just about collecting business cards or making connections on social media\u2014it\u2019s also about cultivating meaningful relationships that can positively impact your career path.\nThe practice of networking is an invaluable source of knowledge and experience. When you connect with professionals who have more expertise in the industry (in this case, Azure services), you gain access to valuable insights, best practices, and industry trends. Engaging in conversations with like-minded individuals can expand your perspective, challenge your assumptions, and inspire innovative thinking.\nNetworking events, conferences, and seminars provide opportunities to learn from industry leaders, attend workshops, and gain new knowledge that can enhance your skill set and help make you a more competitive professional in your new Azure role. Let\u2019s explore some of these roles in greater detail.\n## What do Azure solutions architects do?\nAzure solutions architects play a crucial role in designing, implementing, and managing cloud-based solutions using Azure. They have a deep understanding of Azure services and can architect scalable and secure cloud infrastructures. As an Azure solution architect, you collaborate with clients or colleagues to develop cloud strategies, ensure optimal performance, and provide guidance on best practices. This role requires strong technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and the ability to align business objectives with cloud solutions.\nThe Microsoft Certification exam for this role is Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions, which you can prepare for by completing self-paced AZ-305 learning paths on Microsoft Learn. When you complete a prerequisite (earn the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate certification) and pass Exam AZ-305, you earn the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/community/content/discover-azure-learning-opps#what-about-building-connections"},{"title":"Study guide for Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions","content":"# Study guide for Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions\n## Study resources\nWe recommend that you train and get hands-on experience before you take the exam.
