Skills gaps create project delays and increase the risk of implementation failures. You must develop a multi-faceted approach that combines training, hiring, and partnerships to build sustainable AI capabilities. Here\\u0027s how:\\n1. **Develop internal AI skills through structured learning programs.** Internal skill development provides long-term capability building and ensures knowledge retention within your organization. This approach builds organizational confidence and reduces dependency on external resources. Use the [AI learning hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/) platform for free AI training, certifications, and product guidance. Set certification goals such as [Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/), [Azure AI Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/), and [Azure Data Scientist Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-scientist/) certifications.\\n2. **Recruit AI professionals to fill critical skill gaps beyond internal capacity.** External recruitment provides immediate access to specialized expertise and accelerates project timelines. This strategy helps fill gaps that would take too long to develop internally. Hire experts in model development, generative AI, or AI ethics. Update job descriptions to reflect current skill needs and build an employer brand that emphasizes innovation and technical leadership.\\n3. **Partner with Microsoft experts to supplement your AI capabilities.** Microsoft partnerships provide access to proven expertise and industry best practices while reducing implementation risk. This approach accelerates learning and ensures alignment with Microsoft AI technologies. Use the [Microsoft partners marketplace](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) to access AI, data, and Azure expertise across industries.\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/plan#acquire-ai-skills\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Announcing New Data and AI Certifications from Microsoft: What They Are and How to Earn One\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# Announcing New Data and AI Certifications from Microsoft: What They Are and How to Earn One\\n## Questions?\\n[Skill up and stand out, with new role-based training and certification!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\\u0026Id=375161)[Catching up: continuing our journey with new role-based certifications and training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\\u0026Id=375200)[New role-based certification and training is here, and we\\u2019re just getting started!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\\u0026Id=375159)[Calling Azure Data Engineers!

Skills gaps create project delays and increase the risk of implementation failures. You must develop a multi-faceted approach that combines training, hiring, and partnerships to build sustainable AI capabilities. Here\u0027s how:\n1. **Develop internal AI skills through structured learning programs.** Internal skill development provides long-term capability building and ensures knowledge retention within your organization. This approach builds organizational confidence and reduces dependency on external resources. Use the [AI learning hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/) platform for free AI training, certifications, and product guidance. Set certification goals such as [Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/), [Azure AI Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/), and [Azure Data Scientist Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-scientist/) certifications.\n2. **Recruit AI professionals to fill critical skill gaps beyond internal capacity.** External recruitment provides immediate access to specialized expertise and accelerates project timelines. This strategy helps fill gaps that would take too long to develop internally. Hire experts in model development, generative AI, or AI ethics. Update job descriptions to reflect current skill needs and build an employer brand that emphasizes innovation and technical leadership.\n3. **Partner with Microsoft experts to supplement your AI capabilities.** Microsoft partnerships provide access to proven expertise and industry best practices while reducing implementation risk. This approach accelerates learning and ensures alignment with Microsoft AI technologies. Use the [Microsoft partners marketplace](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) to access AI, data, and Azure expertise across industries.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/plan#acquire-ai-skills"},{"title":"Announcing New Data and AI Certifications from Microsoft: What They Are and How to Earn One","content":"# Announcing New Data and AI Certifications from Microsoft: What They Are and How to Earn One\n## Questions?\n[Skill up and stand out, with new role-based training and certification!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\u0026Id=375161)[Catching up: continuing our journey with new role-based certifications and training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\u0026Id=375200)[New role-based certification and training is here, and we\u2019re just getting started!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8\u0026Id=375159)[Calling Azure Data Engineers!
