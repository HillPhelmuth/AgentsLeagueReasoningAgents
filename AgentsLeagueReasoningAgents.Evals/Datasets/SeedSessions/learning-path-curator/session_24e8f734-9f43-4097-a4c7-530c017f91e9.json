We have included two versions of the Skills Measured objectives depending on when you are taking the exam.\\nWe always update the English language version of the exam first. Some exams are localized into other languages, and those are updated approximately eight weeks after the English version is updated. While Microsoft makes every effort to update localized versions as noted, there may be times when the localized versions of an exam are not updated on this schedule. Other available languages are listed in the **Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the exam isn\\u0027t available in your preferred language, you can request an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam.\\n#### Note\\nThe bullets that follow each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill.
