The course is designed as a blended learning experience that combines instructor-led training with online materials on the Microsoft Learn platform (https://azure.com/learn). The hands-on exercises in the course are based on Learn modules, and students are encouraged to use the content on Learn as reference materials to reinforce what they learn in the class and to explore topics in more depth.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Audience Profile\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Introduction to AI in Azure course is designed for anyone interested in learning about the types of solution artificial intelligence (AI) makes possible, and the services on Microsoft Azure that you can use to create them. You don\\u2019t need to have any experience of using Microsoft Azure before taking this course, but a basic level of familiarity with computer technology and the Internet is assumed. Some of the concepts covered in the course require a basic understanding of mathematics, such as the ability to interpret charts. The course includes hands-on activities that involve working with data and running code, so a knowledge of fundamental programming principles will be helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Skills earned upon completion\\r\\n\\r\\n- Loading...\\r\\n- Loading...\\r\\n- Loading...\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/training/courses/ai-900t00\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Microsoft Applied Skills: Develop generative AI apps with Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel - Applied Skills\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022Applied Skills \\r\\n\\r\\n# Microsoft Applied Skills: Develop generative AI apps with Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel\\r\\n\\r\\n Validate your technical skills and open doors to new possibilities of advancement with Microsoft Applied Skills. \\r\\n\\r\\n##  At a glance\\r\\n\\r\\n- Level \\r\\n\\r\\n[Intermediate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?levels=intermediate\\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\\r\\n- Product \\r\\n\\r\\n[Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?products=azure-openai\\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\\r\\n- Role \\r\\n\\r\\n[AI Engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?roles=ai-engineer\\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)[Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?roles=developer\\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\\r\\n- Subject \\r\\n\\r\\n[Natural language processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?subjects=natural-language-processing\\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nWarning\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English language version of this Applied Skill assessment lab was updated on April 30, 2025.

The course is not designed to teach students to become professional data scientists or software developers, but rather to build awareness of common AI workloads and the ability to identify Azure services to support them. The course is designed as a blended learning experience that combines instructor-led training with online materials on the Microsoft Learn platform (https://azure.com/learn). The hands-on exercises in the course are based on Learn modules, and students are encouraged to use the content on Learn as reference materials to reinforce what they learn in the class and to explore topics in more depth.\r\n\r\n#### Audience Profile\r\n\r\nThe Introduction to AI in Azure course is designed for anyone interested in learning about the types of solution artificial intelligence (AI) makes possible, and the services on Microsoft Azure that you can use to create them. You don\u2019t need to have any experience of using Microsoft Azure before taking this course, but a basic level of familiarity with computer technology and the Internet is assumed. Some of the concepts covered in the course require a basic understanding of mathematics, such as the ability to interpret charts. The course includes hands-on activities that involve working with data and running code, so a knowledge of fundamental programming principles will be helpful.\r\n\r\n### Skills earned upon completion\r\n\r\n- Loading...\r\n- Loading...\r\n- Loading...","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/training/courses/ai-900t00"},{"title":"Microsoft Applied Skills: Develop generative AI apps with Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel - Applied Skills","content":"Applied Skills \r\n\r\n# Microsoft Applied Skills: Develop generative AI apps with Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel\r\n\r\n Validate your technical skills and open doors to new possibilities of advancement with Microsoft Applied Skills. \r\n\r\n##  At a glance\r\n\r\n- Level \r\n\r\n[Intermediate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?levels=intermediate\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\r\n- Product \r\n\r\n[Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?products=azure-openai\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\r\n- Role \r\n\r\n[AI Engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?roles=ai-engineer\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)[Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?roles=developer\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\r\n- Subject \r\n\r\n[Natural language processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?subjects=natural-language-processing\u0026amp;credential_types=applied%20skills)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWarning\r\n\r\nThe English language version of this Applied Skill assessment lab was updated on April 30, 2025.
