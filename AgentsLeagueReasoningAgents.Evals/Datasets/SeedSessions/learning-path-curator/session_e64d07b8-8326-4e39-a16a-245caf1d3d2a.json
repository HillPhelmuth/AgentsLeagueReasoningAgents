We have included two versions of the Skills Measured objectives depending on when you are taking the exam.\r\n\r\nWe always update the English language version of the exam first. Some exams are localized into other languages, and those are updated approximately eight weeks after the English version is updated. While Microsoft makes every effort to update localized exams as noted, there may be times when the localized versions of an exam are not updated on this schedule. Other available languages are listed in the **Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the exam isn\u0027t available in your preferred language, you can request an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nThe bullets that follow each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill. Related topics may be covered in the exam.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nMost questions cover features that are general availability (GA). The exam may contain questions on Preview features if those features are commonly used.\r\n\r\n## Skills measured as of December 23, 2025\r\n\r\n### Audience profile\r\n\r\nAs a Microsoft Azure AI engineer, you build, manage, and deploy AI solutions that leverage Azure AI.\r\n\r\nYour responsibilities include participating in all phases of AI solutions development, including:\r\n\r\n- Requirements definition and design\r\n- Development\r\n- Deployment\r\n- Integration\r\n- Maintenance\r\n- Performance tuning\r\n- Monitoring\r\n\r\nYou work with solution architects to translate their vision.

The [quickstarts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier) are step-by-step instructions that let you make calls to the service and get results in a short period of time.\\n2. The [how-to guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/test-your-model) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.\\nFor a more structured approach, follow a **Training module** for Custom Vision:\\n1. [Classify images with the Custom Vision service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/classify-images-custom-vision/)\\n2. [Classify endangered bird species with Custom Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cv-classify-bird-species/)\\n## How it works\\nThe Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images for custom features. You submit sets of images that do and don\\u0027t have the visual characteristics you\\u0027re looking for. Then you label the images with your own labels (tags) at the time of submission. The algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on the same images. Once you\\u0027ve trained your model, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it in your image recognition app to [classify images](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier) or [detect objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector). You can also [export the model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/export-your-model) for offline use.\\n### Classification and object detection\\nCustom Vision functionality can be divided into two features. **[Image classification](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier)** applies one or more labels to an entire image. **[Object detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector)** is similar, but it returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label(s) are found.\\n### Use case optimization\\nThe Custom Vision service is optimized to quickly recognize major differences between images, so you can start prototyping your model with a small amount of data. It\\u0027s generally a good start to use 50 images per label. However, the service isn\\u0027t optimal for detecting subtle differences in images (for example, detecting minor cracks or dents in quality assurance scenarios).\\nAdditionally, you can choose from several variations of the Custom Vision algorithm that are optimized for images with certain subject material\\u2014for example, landmarks or retail items.

In this tutorial, you\u0027ll learn how to use [Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/) to analyze images on Azure Synapse Analytics.\nThis tutorial demonstrates using text analytics with [SynapseML](https://github.com/microsoft/SynapseML) to:\n1. Extract visual features from the image content\n2. Recognize characters from images (OCR)\n3. Analyze image content and generate thumbnail\n4. Detect and identify domain-specific content in an image\n5. Generate tags related to an image\n6. Generate a description of an entire image in human-readable language\n## Analyze image\nExtracts a rich set of visual features based on the image content, such as objects, faces, adult content, and autogenerated text descriptions.\n### Example input\n![Photograph of a dog.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/media/tutorial-computer-vision-use-mmlspark/dog.jpg)\n### Expected results\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n[\u0022dog\u0022,\u0022outdoor\u0022,\u0022fence\u0022,\u0022wooden\u0022,\u0022small\u0022,\u0022brown\u0022,\u0022building\u0022,\u0022sitting\u0022,\u0022front\u0022,\u0022bench\u0022,\u0022standing\u0022,\u0022table\u0022,\u0022walking\u0022,\u0022board\u0022,\u0022beach\u0022,\u0022holding\u0022,\u0022bridge\u0022]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-computer-vision-use-mmlspark"},{"title":"What is Custom Vision?","content":"# What is Custom Vision?\n1. The [quickstarts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier) are step-by-step instructions that let you make calls to the service and get results in a short period of time.\n2. The [how-to guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/test-your-model) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.\nFor a more structured approach, follow a **Training module** for Custom Vision:\n1. [Classify images with the Custom Vision service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/classify-images-custom-vision/)\n2. [Classify endangered bird species with Custom Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cv-classify-bird-species/)\n## How it works\nThe Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images for custom features. You submit sets of images that do and don\u0027t have the visual characteristics you\u0027re looking for. Then you label the images with your own labels (tags) at the time of submission. The algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on the same images. Once you\u0027ve trained your model, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it in your image recognition app to [classify images](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier) or [detect objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector). You can also [export the model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/export-your-model) for offline use.\n### Classification and object detection\nCustom Vision functionality can be divided into two features. **[Image classification](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier)** applies one or more labels to an entire image. **[Object detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/get-started-build-detector)** is similar, but it returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label(s) are found.\n### Use case optimization\nThe Custom Vision service is optimized to quickly recognize major differences between images, so you can start prototyping your model with a small amount of data. It\u0027s generally a good start to use 50 images per label. However, the service isn\u0027t optimal for detecting subtle differences in images (for example, detecting minor cracks or dents in quality assurance scenarios).\nAdditionally, you can choose from several variations of the Custom Vision algorithm that are optimized for images with certain subject material\u2014for example, landmarks or retail items.
