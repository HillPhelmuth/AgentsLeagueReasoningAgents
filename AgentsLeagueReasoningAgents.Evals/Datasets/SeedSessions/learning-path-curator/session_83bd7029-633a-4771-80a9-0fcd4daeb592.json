It provides these suggestions directly in the editor while you write your code, and it can work with a broad range of programming languages and frameworks.\\nCopilot provides two kinds of inline suggestions, both of which take your existing code into account:\\n1. **Completions** - As you type in the editor, Copilot provides ghost text suggestions with colorized syntax highlighting at your current cursor location.\\n2. **Next edit suggestions** - Based on your current editing patterns, NES predicts both where your next code edit will be and what changes you\\u0027ll make.\\n## How GitHub Copilot works\\nGitHub Copilot works by using advanced machine-learning models trained on a vast dataset of publicly available code from GitHub repositories. As you type code, AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real time. You can also receive suggestions by writing a comment in natural language that describes what you want the code to do.\\n![Animated screenshot that shows code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/media/vs-2022/github-copilot-extension-example.gif?view=visualstudio)\\nYou can also use GitHub Copilot to convert comments to code, create unit tests, create SQL queries, and more.\\n## Prerequisites\\n1.

As you type code, the AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real-time. You can receive suggestions also by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.\\nThe GitHub Copilot extension in Azure Data Studio uses context from the editor to provide suggestions. For example, if you\\u0027re writing a query that joins two tables, GitHub Copilot suggests the join condition from columns in the open editor, other files in the workspace, and common syntax patterns.\\n## Privacy\\nYour code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) to ensure that your code snippets aren\\u0027t used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-data-studio/extensions/github-copilot-extension-overview#how-github-copilot-works\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022Use GitHub Copilot to create WinUI / Windows App SDK apps in Visual Studio\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# Use GitHub Copilot to create WinUI / Windows App SDK apps in Visual Studio\\n## Use GitHub Copilot\\n### Autocomplete your code snippets\\nGitHub Copilot in Visual Studio provides real-time code suggestions and completions based on the code you write. The most straightforward way to use Copilot is to start typing code in the editor, and Copilot will try to autocomplete your code snippet. You can then accept or dismiss the suggestions:\\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (basic autocomplete).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/1-basic-autocomplete.png)\\nTip\\nIf you don\\u0027t see the GitHub Copilot suggestions, you can enable different aspects of the feature in Visual Studio\\u0027s options under \\u0060Tools\\u0060 -\\u003E \\u0060Options\\u0060 -\\u003E \\u0060GitHub\\u0060 -\\u003E \\u0060Copilot\\u0060.\\n### Ask Copilot for suggestions\\nRight-click in the code editor and select \\u0060Ask Copilot\\u0060. A prompt window will open where you can chat inline with Copilot to get a list of suggestions based on the current cursor position and your prompt:\\n![Screenshot that shows the inline prompting capabilities of GitHub Copilot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/2-generate-multiple-suggestions.png)\\n### Prompt Copilot with plain-language comments\\nAlthough Copilot is used primarily for code completion, you can also use natural language comments to guide Copilot in generating specific code snippets. For example, you can use comments to request a specific feature or functionality:\\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (prompting).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/3-prompt-copilot-with-inline-comment.png)\\n### Use temporary comments to add code from other files to Copilot\\u0027s context\\nIf you\\u0027re working on a code-behind file and want Copilot to incorporate context from the associated XAML file, you can use temporary comments to include this additional code within Copilot\\u0027s context. Here\\u0027s an example of how you can specify the XAML code first, and then have Copilot generate the corresponding C# code:\\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (context expansion).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/4-add-context-temporary-comments.png)\\n### Ask Copilot to explain how something works with inline comments\\nYou can use inline comments to ask Copilot to explain how a specific piece of code works. This is similar to using the inline Ask Copilot feature or the Copilot Chat window, except your prompt is typed directly into the code editor:\u0022,\u0022contentUrl\u0022:\u0022https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/github-copilot-winui-vs#use-github-copilot\u0022},{\u0022title\u0022:\u0022What is GitHub Copilot for Azure?\u0022,\u0022content\u0022:\u0022# What is GitHub Copilot for Azure?\\nGitHub Copilot for Azure is a GitHub Copilot extension that enables developers to use natural language to:\\n1.

The most straightforward way to use Copilot is to start typing code in the editor, and Copilot will try to autocomplete your code snippet. You can then accept or dismiss the suggestions:\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (basic autocomplete).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/1-basic-autocomplete.png)\nTip\nIf you don\u0027t see the GitHub Copilot suggestions, you can enable different aspects of the feature in Visual Studio\u0027s options under \u0060Tools\u0060 -\u003E \u0060Options\u0060 -\u003E \u0060GitHub\u0060 -\u003E \u0060Copilot\u0060.\n### Ask Copilot for suggestions\nRight-click in the code editor and select \u0060Ask Copilot\u0060.

For example, you can use comments to request a specific feature or functionality:\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (prompting).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/3-prompt-copilot-with-inline-comment.png)\n### Use temporary comments to add code from other files to Copilot\u0027s context\nIf you\u0027re working on a code-behind file and want Copilot to incorporate context from the associated XAML file, you can use temporary comments to include this additional code within Copilot\u0027s context. Here\u0027s an example of how you can specify the XAML code first, and then have Copilot generate the corresponding C# code:\n![Screenshot that shows the code completion capabilities of GitHub Copilot (context expansion).](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/how-tos/images/github-copilot-winui-vs/4-add-context-temporary-comments.png)\n### Ask Copilot to explain how something works with inline comments\nYou can use inline comments to ask Copilot to explain how a specific piece of code works.
